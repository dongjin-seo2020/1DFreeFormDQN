# 1DFreeFromDQN
Design code of 1D free-from deflector metasurface

## target condtion
multiple angles / broadband wavelength learned by a single network

FC: learns the correlation of inputs and infers the maximum Q action (stabilized by Q network & Target Q network) 

## original code condition
deflection angle 60 degree / wavelength 900nm (from [Fan group sample inference case](https://github.com/jonfanlab/GLOnet))

## simulation
The simulation which corresponds to environment runs on MATLAB RCWA open source [Reticolo](https://zenodo.org/record/3610175#.YBkECS2UGX0)
